# Sleeping-TA
The Sleeping TA project uses mutex locks and semaphores. Semaphores are used to (1) signal and wait TA's sleep (2) signal and wait chair for the TA (3) to signal and wait TA's next student. Where as the mutex lock is used to lock and unlock the chaircount. This project was part of my Operation Systems class. I used C to complete this assignment.
